# Unity 3D Familiarizing and Roll-A-Ball Game

## What you built? 

A Unity3D game where the player operates a rolling ball on a medium sized plane. The plane is blocked in by walls and there are shiny rotating boxes floating above the plane throughout the gameplay area that the user needs to collect. Once the user collects all 12 of the shiny rotating boxes then the game displays that the user has one.

This project involved making 3D objects in Unity and adding components that allowed for interaction within the game as well as operating actions in the 3D game through controllers written in C#. The game was built from scratch using a tutorial on the [Learn Unity Website](learn.unity.com).

## Who Did What?

I completed this project alone.

Shane:
* Completed Udemy Course linked below
* Created a Roll-a-ball game using a tutorial on Unity's web page
* Played around for hours in the Unity editor and learned a ton about a new software!

## What you learned
* Unity is a really complicated platform with a large number of nuances that make it really cool but also really hard to understand for a beginner.
* My first three hours of this assignment was taking a Udemy course that helped me familiarize myself with the platform. The course also provided me insight, tips, and tricks on how to get started in the most efficient manner.
* Unity is so cool, I had so much fun playing around with Unity and making this game. I am really excited to make small games in my free time now. I learned that I really enjoy Unity and really enjoy making games, even if they are simple like this ball rolling game.
* I look back on the old console games and there is a really old game called something like Monkeyball where the user controls a ball that is falling down various levels of courses. I learned that I could make a game like that in Unity in only a couple of days and that game used to give me so much enjoyment! I can't imagine how much cooler and easier it would be to make in Unity.
* Sometimes Udemy courses are not that helpful. The guy who taught the Udemy course on Unity ended up talking in circles a lot of the time. There were some gems in the time that I spent listening to him, but in the end I think walking through a tutorial like I did with the Roll a Ball game was far more valuable. Takeaway: Doing and making something is more helpful to my learning than watching someone else show you different formats of Unity.
* Github has a bunch of difficulty with pushing an entire Unity project so it is extremely important to properly configure your .gitignore file.
* How to relate objects in Unity to objects in C# scripts, which is a really unique but cool relationship that I have never seen before! This also seemed like the most practical use of public and private variables where the Unity program had access to the public variables and they could be set to game objects or specific values in the Unity editor.

*** I highly recommend this tutorial, Unity does an amzing job making you want to keep going and it is so much fun ***
